# BlueFoot Tours Milestone Project

This is a four page website for a fictional tour company called BlueFoot Tours who offer services to people visiting the Galapagos Islands. 
It will contain pages detailing services provided with photographs of the area so those visiting have a visual of some of the things they may be able to see themselves.
As it is not a real company, I have limited the depth I go into the tours themselves, otherwise I feel the site would be more complicated than neccessary
and lots of time would have wasted writting up text that wasn't needed.


## UX

This site is aimed at tourists who want to see what the area has to offer, therefore it needs to be interesting but not over complicated.
The index page will be labelled as a 'Home' page with introductory information about the company, the owners and the sort of services that they provide. 
It will also have photos of animals taken on the Galapagos Islands, as will all of the pages. There will be a 'Tours' page which goes into more depth about tours 
the company can run and a contact page with a form for inquires. I later decided to add a photos page to utilise the media I and give the user an improved visual experience.


## Features

The navbar below the logo and title will allow the user to navigate between each page- Home, Tours and Contact, each having different information. 
Clicking on the logo will also bring the user to the Home page. The Contact page has a form with name, email and query sections that would allow the
user to ask questions of the company in regard to tours/extra information. In the footer of each page there are links to social media (Facebook and Instagram)
and TripAdvisor where they would be able to access the sites social media presence and find reviews if the were company real.

## Technologies Used

* Bootstrap- https://getbootstrap.com/ To help me with the general structure, using rows and columnns to simplyfy the layout.
* Font Awesome- https://fontawesome.com/ This allowed my to use different fonts and icons to improve the project look.
* Adobe colour-https://color.adobe.com/create Helped to choose and create the colours for fonts and background.
* Diff Checker- https://www.diffchecker.com/ To check for errors in my code.
* Stack Overflow- https://stackoverflow.com/ to help answer questions I have.
* Chrome DevTools- Helped me fins and fix issues such as margin errors or padding I didn't want/need.

*Testing the form 1. If you try to submit an empty form, warnings come up on each text box asking the user to @fill out this field'
                  2. The email section of the form requires a valid email address with an '@' to be submitted successfully.
                  3. The 'Inquiry' section brings up a Please fill out this field' message if you try to submit an empty field, even.                        the other two fields are filled correctly.
