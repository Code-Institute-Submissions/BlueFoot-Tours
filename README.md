BlueFoot Tours

This is a three page site for people visiting the Galapagos Islands who want to book local tours around the islands.
The first page will be introductory, explaining who we are and the kind of services provided.
Page two will display the available services themselves and page three will be a contact/inquiries page.
This has been inspired by visiting the Galapagos with my fiance
