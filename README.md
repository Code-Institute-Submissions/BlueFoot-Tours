#BlueFoot Tours Milestone Project

This is a four page website for a fictional tour company called BlueFoot Tours who offer services to people visiting the Galapagos Islands. It will contain pages detailing services provided with photographs of the area so those visiting have a visual of some of the things they may be able to see themselves.

###UX

This site is aimed at tourists who want to see what the area has to offer, therefore it needs to be interesting but not over complicated
The index page will be labelled as a 'Home' page with introductory information about the company, the ower and the sort of services that they provide. It will also have photos of animals taken on the Galapagos Islands, as will all of the pages.
There will be a 'Tours' page which goes into more depth about tours the company can run and a contact page with a form for inquires. I may also add a 'Photos' page with aditional photographs to showcase the islands fauna.

###Features

The navbar below the logo and title will allow the user to navigate between each page- Home, Tours and Contact, each having different information. Clicking on the logo will also bring the user to the Home page.
The Contact page has a form with name, email and query sections that would allow the user to ask questions of the company in regard to tours/extra information
In the footer of each page there are links to social media (Facebook and Instagram) and TripAdvisor where they would be able to access the sites social media presence and find reviews were the cmopany real.
